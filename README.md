Hello, I'm Brijesh! &nbsp;👋🏽
========================

Product Owner &nbsp;|&nbsp; Analyst
-------------------------

I have honed my skills in project methodologies such as Agile SCRUM, Waterfall, and RUP and technical skills in SQL, Python, and Tableau. Leveraging tools like Aha! & JIRA, I have optimized bug-tracking processes and enhanced team productivity, ensuring smooth project delivery across multiple systems. I've also cultivated a strong foundation in Product Design (UI/UX). My journey intertwines analytics with a user-centric design ethos. This blend of analytics and design focus propels me to drive projects that resonate well with both stakeholders and end-users.
